1. Routine decleration with a simple print statement.
    * Should be tested twice, one with specifying main and one without.
2. Type and variable decleration were added in addition to 1.
    * only integer was included, further types should be added later.
3. If else condition was added in addition to 2.
4. For loop was added in addition to 3.
5. While loop replaced the for loop in 4 and variable assignment was added.
6. For each will replace the while loop in 5.
7. Simple record decleration with printing its content and performing arithmetic operations on them.
8. Simple array decleration that uses for loop to print its content.
