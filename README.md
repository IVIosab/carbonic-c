<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Carbonic-C Logo](assets/Carbonic_C_logo_horizontal.png)



<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

Carbonic-C is a lightweight imperative programming language with Pascal/Oberon-like syntax. The language supports a set of basic features you would find in any programming language, as well as some more complex ones.
Below are some of the main characteristics of the language:

* The langugae is static. Object types are fixed at object declarations and cannot change during program execution.
* There are three predefined data types: integer, real, boolean.
* There are two predefined data structures: structs, arrays.
* Full expression syntax with usual set of operators.
* The language is compiled, `LLVM` bytecode being the target.
* The structure of the program is a sequence of data and routine declarations.
* The language features a standard set of statements: Assignment, if/while, return, output.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Below are the instructions for setting up the project locally on a Linux machine.
### Prerequisites

* g++ 11.3.0
  ```sh
  sudo apt install g++=11.3.0
  ```

* flex 2.6.4
  ```sh
  sudo apt install flex=2.6.4
  ```

* bison 3.8.2
  ```sh
  sudo apt install bison=3.8.2
  ```

* make 4.3
  ```sh
  sudo apt install make=4.3
  ```

* cmake 3.26.0
  ```sh
  sudo apt install cmake=2.6.4
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The project uses `CMake` as a build tool and contains a `Makefile` to provide an interface to easily use it. Below is the list of commands and their corresponding functionalities. These commands are available directly in the source directory.

* `run` : Runs the compiler in the terminal and expects input from `stdin`. Prints output to `stdout`. This can be used as the "default' command for running the compiler, and is the quickest way to do so.

```sh
  make run
  ```
* `run/file` : Compiles the contents of the `input.crbc` file in the source directory and produces output to `output.out` also in the source directory.

```sh
  make run/file
  ```
* `test` : Runs a large set of valid/invalid Unit and End-to-End tests that test the entire compiler as well as its individual components and features. The test suite is run using `CTest` and prints elaborate output and test stats to the terminal.

```sh
  make test
  ```

* `build` : If not previously built, this command will build the compiler in all of its stages and produce a single executable file. All generated files can be found in `carbonic-c/build`. If previously built, this command will build partially (re-compiling only files that have been touched since last built). This should be used as the default command for building the project after any changes are made.

```sh
  make build
  ```

* `clean` : Removes all previously generated build and output files. This command can be used to restore the project to its "default" state

```sh
  make clean
  ```

* `build/all` : Runs `clean`, removing all previously generated files and resetting the project, after that it builds the project from scratch with all of its components.

```sh
  make build/all
  ```
